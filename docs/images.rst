Categories & Translations
-------------------------

When you upload an image you must add categories denoting:
    1. What version of FFOS the image is associated with.
    2. What language uses the image.

Localized verions of the same image should be given the exact same name.


.. Important::
    Only en images will appear in the CMS. The localized versions will be inserted automatically
    when the site is viewed. The names must be an exact match for this to work.
